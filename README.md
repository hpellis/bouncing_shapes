# Bouncing Shapes

I completed this project while learning object-oriented programming. 

This involved importing and customising Python’s turtle module, which is used to draw patterns within a frame. The base_classes.py file contains classes and methods for the frame, shapes and colours. 

The moving_shapes.py file contains classes for shapes, and methods that control their movement within the frame. This includes setting different minimum and maximum x and y values for the different shapes, so that they don’t cross the boundaries of the frame. 

Running the single_shape.py file will cause an instance of the square subclass to be created and move through the frame. 

Running the multiple_shapes.py file will cause three square, three diamonds and three circles to be created and move across the frame according to their specific methods. 


## Installation
To run this you need to clone the repository and run either the single_shape.py or multiple_shapes.py file. This launches a separate frame which contains the bouncing shapes.
